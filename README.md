## 🎯 Mission

The trenches can be brutal. New traders lose money, miss opportunities, and fall victim to scams every single day. **Soly** is here to change that.

We're building an autonomous AI agent that monitors the Solana ecosystem 24/7, providing real-time insights, warnings, and actionable advice to help trenchers make smarter decisions and actually make it out alive.

## 🎓 Survival Guide for New Trenchers

### Rule #1: Never Invest More Than You Can Afford to Lose
The trenches are high-risk, high-reward. Only trade with money you're comfortable losing.

### Rule #2: DYOR (Do Your Own Research)
Soly provides insights, but YOU make the final decision. Always verify before you buy.

### Rule #3: Take Profits
Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. Set targets and stick to them.

### Rule #4: Avoid FOMO
Missing a pump hurts less than getting rugged. There's always another opportunity.

### Rule #5: Manage Your Risk
Never go all-in on a single play. Diversify your bets and use stop-losses.

### Rule #6: Learn from Losses
Every loss is a lesson. Analyze what went wrong and adjust your strategy.

### Rule #7: Stay Calm Under Pressure
Emotional trading leads to bad decisions. Trust your process.
